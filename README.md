Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
==========

Team: Jerry Chang, Michael Woo, Ace Eldeib

CS51 Final Project, Spring 2014

## Description

For this project, we implemented a Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier using preprocessed data of Amazon Product Reviews.

Our classifier can predict with 80% accuracy whether a given product review is positive and negative. We also attempt to predict the rating the user will give the product based on his review as well as a confidence for our predictions. Below is the live project website deployed on Google App Engine.
