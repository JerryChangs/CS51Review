Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
==========

Team: Jerry Chang, Michael Woo, Ace Eldeib

CS51 Final Project, Spring 2014

## Description

For this project, we implemented an algorithm to classify Amazon product reviews as negative or positive with 80% accuracy. Using pre-processed Amazon data, we used python to parse the data and create a bag-of-words model which computes the probability that each word goes alond with a positive or negative review. We then sum these values to determine the overall sentiment of a given review. Below is the live project website deployed on Google App Engine. See testmodel.py for implementation details.
